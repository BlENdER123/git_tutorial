Squat 5x5
Pull-ups 5x5
Overhead Press 5x5
B

Bench Press 5x5
C
Squat 5x5
Pull up 5x5
Overhead Press 5x5
Do this sequence every week (maybe Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and steadily increase the weight each session. Once you're making progress, feel free to add in other exercises like dips or more Olympic lifts.
